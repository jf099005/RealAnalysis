## Recall
if $\phi$ cont. in $R$ and $f$ measurable and finite a.e.  then $f\phi(f)$ measurable a.e.



## Example
1. if $f,g$ measruable, then $\{f>g\}=\cup_{q_k\in Q}\{f>q_k>g\}$ measurble


2. let $f_k$ be a sequence of measurable function, then
- $\sup_{k}f_k(x)$ and $\inf_k f_k(x)$ measurable
- $\liminf_k f_k(x)$, $\limsup_k f_k(x)$ measurable

proof of 1.
$\{x:\inf_k f_k(x)<a\}=\cap_k \{f_k(x)<a\}$
$\{x:\sup_k f_k(x)>a\}=\cup_k \{f_k(x)>a\}$, therfore measurable
therfore measurable, and by definition $\inf_kf$ and $\sup_k f$ measurable

proof of 2.
$\{\liminf_k f_k(x)>a\}=\cup_n \cap_{k\ge n}\{f_k(x)>a\}$
$\{\limsup_k f_k(x)>a\}=\cap_n \cup_{k\ge n}\{f_k(x)>a\}$

Therefore, both measurable

## Def.
$f$ is called a simple function if $f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^N a_k \chi_{E_k}$, $a_1,...,a_N\in\mathbb R,E_1,...,E_N$ are disjoint subsets.

where $\chi_E=\begin{cases}
1&x\in E\\
0&x\notin E
\end{cases}$

#### remark
$f$ measurable $\iff$ $E_1,E_2,...E_N$ are measurable sets

## Therorem
- 1. every function $f$ can be written as the limit of a sequence of simple functions

- 2.
