## Recall a key lemma
#### Lemma
if $E\subseteq \mathbb R^1$ and $E$ measurable with $|E|>0$
Then the set $\{d=x-y:x,y\in E\}\subseteq \mathbb R$ contain an interval centered at $0$

lemma $\implies$ Construct a nen-measurable set in $\mathbb R^1$(Vitali)

in the proof, we use $\mathbb R^1=\cup_{q\in\mathbb Q}\{V+q\},V$ is the non-measurable set

## Theorem
Let $A$ be a subset of $\mathbb R^1$ with $|A|_e>0$, then $A$ contains  non-measurable subset.

#### proof:
$A=\cup_{q\in\mathbb Q} (\{V+q\} \cap A)=\cup_{q\\in\mathbb Q} A_q$, where $A_q=A\cap \{V+q\}$

Each $\{d=x-y:x,y\in A_q\}$ cannot contain an interval centered at $0$
So either $A_q$ is non-measurable or $|A_q|=0$

But, $|A|_e\le \sum_{q\in \mathbb Q}|A_q|=0$ if $|A_q|=0\forall q$, contradiction

Therefore, at least one $A_q$ is non-measurable

# Lebesgue measurable sets and  Borel sets
Denote $\mathcal{L}:$ Lebesgue measurable sets ($\sigma-$algebra)

$\mathcal{B}$: Borel sets (the smallest $\sigma-$algebra containing all open sets in $\mathbb R^n$)

$\implies \mathcal{B}\subseteq \mathcal L$, is the inequality hold?

Let $\lambda$ be the Lebesgue measure of $\mathbb R^n$, then $\lambda_\mathcal B$
 is a measurable defined on $\mathcal B$, such a measure is called **Borel Measure**.

## Def.
Let $(X,\mathcal A,\mu)$ be a measurable space, this space is called  complete if for any $A\in \mathcal A$ with $\mu(A)=0$, then $B\in \mathcal A$ whenever $B\subseteq A$(and then $\mu(B)=0$)
